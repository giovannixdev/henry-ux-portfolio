            <h3 class="heading-tertiary white">Project focused concept</h3>
            <p class="p-discovery white">Our first concept revolved around keeping the site project based. Our users would have a general overview of their projects and could at a glance see who contributed to what project.</p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">We discussed about our research and felt that this concept didn’t address enough of our users pain points. It focused heavily on the community aspect of building a project but lacked solutions to providing confidence in feedback.</p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">The visual layout of this sketch was something we liked and pushed through to our future lo-fi designs.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-tertiary white">Addressing the source problem</h2>
            <p class="p-discovery white">This concept was a direct result of our thinking. Variable circles would represent individuals who contributed more to the project. This idea was attempting to tackle the issue of quality of feedback. The more an individual would contribute to a circle the larger it would get.</p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">We had the idea of a coursel users would interact with to navigate between projects. This idea also had a similar visual layout with projects and a more in-depth view shown side-to-side.</p>

          <p class="p-discovery white">Summarizing these sketches into a concrete list of ideas was helpful for the beginning of our lo-fi process. </p>
          <p class="p-discovery white">The circle concept was abandoned even before we jumped into our wireframes. We felt that this idea wouldn’t be practical for onboarding new users. There are established methods of showing interaction.</p>
          <p class="p-discovery white">The horizontal and vertical layout ideas were things we explored in our wireframes. The concept of having 2 separate ideas shown on 1 screen seemed like a good idea to limit the number of screens the user had to navigate through.</p>

            <p class="p-discovery white">Our main objective was to have everything the user needs on the homepage.</p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">One side would consist of projects to review, while the other side would be incoming feedback.</p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">We had similar concepts with our previous discussion in mind.</p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">The major deviation between our designs are the <span style="color:#83F58E">horizonal carosel</span> and the <span style="color:#EEB258">vertical scrolling.</span></p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">We discussed and landed on vertical scrolling. Our hope was that users could view a substantial amount of projects in a short time. A carosel would be more difficult to navigate between projects.</p>
            <p class="p-discovery white">The design was too busy having 2 different views on one screen. We found that separating these views into 2 pages cleaned up the design and made it less intimidating.</p>

              <p class="p-discovery white">The crown was an idea we had to distinguish members that frequently gave valuable feedback.</p>
              <p class="p-discovery white">Even with these changes we still found that the page would be difficult to read. To help guide the user through the flow we implemented an idea of a tutorial for the site.</p>

Going forward the changes to make would be to move all the interactable elements to the left side of the screen. There could also be a version with the feedback form taking up the entire screen.</p>
